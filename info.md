# Pusher
A game made at the SimpleWeb hackathon in 3 hours using the Pusher notification system. 2 players scan qr codes on mobile devices to play against each other. They have to tap their phone screens to shoot bullets at each other.


# How it works:
It uses pusher to transfer data between players phones and the game server. QR codes are generated displaying a link to the webserver with different player parameters

# Instructions for setup:
You need to run this on a server that has public http access.<br />
Change the url address in game.html to your web address.<br />
Change the port number in webserver.js either 8080 or 80<br />
Run the command "node webserver.js" while in the root directory.<br />
Then load up the url of the game.html in a web browser. <br />

<br /><br />
Enjoy!
